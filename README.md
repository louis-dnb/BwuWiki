# Website

This project hosts the [BotWithUs Wiki](https://wiki.botwithus.net), containing documentation for our RS3 bot.
This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.
Here are the [Docusuarus markdown docs](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features)

### Contributing

In order to contribute to our wiki, please either fork our repo or create a branch, and make a pull request to the master branch of this repo. Once we review and approve it, the changes will go live to the site in minutes.

### Honorable Mentions
Thank you @dea.d for providing a great jump start to this project.

### Installation
This project requires that you  have [NPM 18+](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v18.12.0) installed.

Copy this repo, if you haven't already
```

Then, from the root of this project, to install this projects dependencies:

### Local Development
```
yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. When you save changes in the files (like the markdown files for the wiki, they should reflect automatically in your local browser)

```

```
This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service. You dont really need this to contribute, its relevant to hosting the wiki.
